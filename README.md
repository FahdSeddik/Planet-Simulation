# Planet-Simulation
-This is a planet simulation developed with python using pygame.  
-This simulates accurate forces using Newton's universal law of gravitation.  
-Accurate model of mass, and distance between planets, however, not size so we can see the planets :)  
-I used data provided from NASA to get accurate distances in astronomical units (AU).   
-Orbits are elliptical but not visible due to scale.  
-Distance from sun is displayed on each planet to prove that its changing and not a circle.
